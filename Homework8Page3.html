      <h2>WITHOUT USING RELATIVE OR ABSOLUTE POSITIONING, WHAT IS <br><br> ANOTHER WAY TO ORGANIZE ELEMENTS ON A PAGE?</h2>
      <p>Without using any of those you can still use the other 3 of the 5 positioning methods wich are Static, Fixed and Sticky and of course by using a more complicated one, wich is the CSS</p>

        <h3>WHY YOU CHOSE THE COLORS AND THE IMAGES YOU SELECTED?</h3>
        <p>I decided to make use of this color palette because I felt that it would be a good simple and very cool combination, blue combines well with grey, white and black and if you think about it all this colors go with each other very well. I chosed the images that I put in this pages because they are a representation of what I am talking about wich is cats so I put pictures of cats.<br>
        I would give this assigment a 4 out of 5 because it was very well xplained and multiple examples where given overall a great expereibnece and I guess the material would be easier if previus tutorials wold be link to fo example a code of how to make the nav area on the aside.</p>
